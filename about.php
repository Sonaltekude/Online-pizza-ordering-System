    <p>An online food ordering system allows your business to accept and manage orders placed online for delivery or takeaway. Customers browse a digital menu, either on an app or website and place and pay for their order online.<br> Venues will then receive the order details via their chosen online food ordering system and produce the order ready for delivery or customer pickup.
    While online food ordering systems have been around for several years, demand for this technology took off during the pandemic. With extended lockdowns and restrictions, hospitality venues quickly pivoted their businesses to offer online ordering solutions so their customers could continue to enjoy restaurant-quality food at home. </p>
